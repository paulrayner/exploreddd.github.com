       <h2>Hands-On Session</h2>
        <h2 class="gold">Hands-on Visual Communication for DDD</h2>
       <p>Applying reusable communication design patterns</p>
        <p>Communicating design and architecture is a crucial aspect of being a successful technical professional, however, this is a skill you don't get taught. Learning by trial and error is not ideal, so how do you create inclusive diagrams and visuals that successfully communicate to your audience?</p>
        <p>Apply communication design patterns and recognise antipatterns.</p>
        <p>The purpose of a diagram is to successfully communicate with the audience, which sounds deceptively simple. Communication design patterns can be applied to guide you towards this ultimate goal of successful communication in Domain Driven Design, and towards maximum inclusion for your audience.</p>
        <p>In this practical workshop, learn from a hands-on solution architect - and thought leader in communication patterns - how to apply design patterns to tailor your DDD visuals and software diagrams to your audience, choose the most appropriate standards (or not) and level of detail, and improve accessibility for all audiences. We will use free open-source tools accessible via the internet.</p>
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
