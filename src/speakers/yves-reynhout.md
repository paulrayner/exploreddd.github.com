      <p class="copy">Yves is very passionate. Passionate about what he does and how he lives his life. Apart from the constant improvement of his skill set, he also gives back; sharing what he has learned. Loyalty, "firm but fair" and empathy are traits people have come to associate with Yves. Though getting results is what counts, he fully realizes the journey is what gets us there.</p>
