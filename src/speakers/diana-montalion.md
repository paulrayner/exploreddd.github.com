        <h2>Hands-On Session</h2>
        <h2 class="gold">Strengthening Systems Thinking by Writing</h2>
        <p>At DDD conferences, we focus a lot on modeling but not on writing. Most of us working as systems designers do A LOT of communicating. Writing is a fabulous tool for thinking and learning.</p>
        <p>As software designers, we craft knowledge. We weave other people’s thinking and experiences with our own to solve problems. We construct valuable recommendations and learn through communication.</p>
        <p>Systems thinking is a practice -- or, rather, a system of foundational practices that improve our nonlinear thinking skills. One of those foundational practices is creating conceptual integrity. Constructing something whole and actionable from abstract ideas. Fred Brooks says:</p>
        <p><em>"Conceptual integrity is the most important consideration in systems design."</em></p>
        <p>Unfortunately, we are truly terrible at creating or maintaining conceptual integrity. Fortunately, writing is the practice of crafting conceptual integrity.</p>
        <p>Writing practices can help us:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>strengthen metacognition: awareness of our own thought process.</li>
          <li>synthesize knowledge, experience and sound judgment into well-reasoned recommendations.</li>
          <li>learn.</li>
          <li>navigate uncertainty through inquiry.</li>
          <li>think well, together.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this hands-on lab, we will write. You'll try writing practices that, when done regularly, improve your ability to think, learn and lead. Including timed free writing, systemic reasoning, modeling artifacts and structuring recommendations for varying audiences.</p>
        <p>Fair warning: it will be a lot of fun.</p>
        <p>Bring your favorite pen.</p>
