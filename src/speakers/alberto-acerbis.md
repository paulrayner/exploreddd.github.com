       <p>I am basically an eternal onlooker. I've always defined myself as a backend developer, but I don't disdain poking around on the other side of the code either. I like to think that 'writing' software is mainly about solving business problems and providing value to the customer, and in this I find DDD patterns a great help. I work as a software engineer at Intré, a company that espouses this ideology.</p> 
        <p>As a good introvert, I find it difficult to come out of the closet, but I like to get out of my comfort zone to share with others the things I have learnt, so that I can find the right stimuli each time to continue improving. I like to frequent the community world, contributing, when I can, with active proposals. I am a co-founder of the DDD Open community and Polenta and Deploy community, and an active member of other communities such as Blazor Developer Italiani. I am an Azure Solution Architect and Azure IoT Developer.</p>
       <h2>Hands-On Session</h2>
        <h2 class="gold">Bounded Context is not Enough!</h2>
        <h3>Co-Presented with <a href="alessandro-colla.html">Alessandro Colla</a></h3>
       <p>When we consider creating a distributed system, frequently we use Bounded Contexts to handle specific business functions within clearly defined boundaries.</p>
        <p>But is this enough? What about the static dependencies that each microservice has with the database or the servicebus or even with the frontend?</p>
        <p>In this workshop we will explore the concept of Architectural Quantum (an independently deployable component with high functional cohesion) and how it can help us to create a distributed system with a clear separation of concerns.</p>
        <p>Join us to discover a way to implement this architectural solution.</p>
