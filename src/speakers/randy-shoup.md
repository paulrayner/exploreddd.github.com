        <p>Randy has spent more than 30 years building distributed systems and high performing teams, and has worked as a senior technology leader at eBay, Google, and Stitch Fix. He coaches CTOs, advises companies, and generally makes a nuisance of himself wherever possible. He was most recently VP Engineering and Chief Architect at eBay, and is particularly interested in the nexus between culture, technology, and organization.</p>

        <h2 class="gold">Large-Scale Architecture: The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Simplicity</h2>
        <p>Building distributed systems that work is hard. And scaling those systems by multiple orders of magnitude is even harder. Using examples from internet-scale consumer properties like Google, Amazon, and eBay, this talk deep-dives into the counterintuitive idea that the key to success in large-scale architecture is simplicity.</p>
        <p>We first discuss simple components like modular services, orthogonal domain logic, and service layering. Next we discuss simple interactions between components, leveraging event-driven models, immutable logs, and asynchronous dataflow. Then we explore techniques that simplify making changes the system, including incremental changes, continuous testing, canary deployments, and feature flags.</p>
        <p>In the final part of the talk, we show how all these ideas work together with specific architectural examples from Amazon, Netflix, and Walmart.</p>
        <p>You will take away actionable insights you can immediately put into practice in your own systems.</p>
