       <span class="speaker-subtitle">When & How Studios</span>
       <p></p>
       <p>Dan Young and Mike Rozinsky work together, across the Atlantic. Through the When & How Studios project they help create participatory experiences and meaningful conversations that connect and activate groups of people around the world. They work online, in-person, and everywhere in between.</p>
        <p>In the last 20 years Dan has tinkered with network engineering, collided with consulting, played in product strategy and fallen into entrepreneurship. By reflecting on all his experience Dan has developed his own organizational development practice called Needs Workshop through which he supports invitational change, offers consulting with a curious approach, and facilitates gatherings to transform the way people come together at work.</p>
        <p>As a self-described #conflicthugger, Mike partners to create impact through a variety of conflict management, people development, facilitation, change enablement, visual storytelling, restorative justice, and organizational development practices and workshops. Together these approaches seek to build a community of support, make things discussable, draw out options for exploration, provide for agency, and empower people.</p>
        <h2>Hands-On Session</h2>
        <h2 class="gold">Design Intentional Group Experiences for Software Design and Decision-Making</h2>
        <p>This workshop supports anyone who has the responsibility of bringing groups together for collaborative activities such as software design, modeling or decision-making. You’ll solve the common problems you experience when running group work in your context by leveraging 16 Design Aspects.</p>
        <p>The 16 Design Aspects have been developed from Dan Young and Mike Rozinsky’s experience coaching individuals as well as designing and delivering experiences for groups of 3 to 800 people - online, in-person, and spaces in between. In this session, you will work alongside Dan and Mike as well as your peers to design, prepare and facilitate software design and decision-making sessions for any size group and any type of space.</p>
        <p>Dan and Mike invite you to join them to further your group-work design practice by thinking more deeply about how to be intentional in the way you bring people together to design software.</p>
        <p>To get the most out of the workshop, please bring something to take notes in and ideally a laptop or other device to access online materials and resources.</p>
