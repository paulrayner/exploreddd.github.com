       <p></p>
       <p>Dan Young and Mike Rozinsky work together, across the Atlantic. Through the When & How Studios project they help create participatory experiences and meaningful conversations that connect and activate groups of people around the world. They work online, in-person, and everywhere in between.</p>
        <p>In the last 20 years Dan has tinkered with network engineering, collided with consulting, played in product strategy and fallen into entrepreneurship.</p>
        <p>By reflecting on all his experience Dan has developed his own organizational development practice called Needs Workshop; through which he supports invitational change, offers consulting with a curious approach, and facilitates gatherings to transform the way people come together at work.</p>
        <p>As a self-described #conflicthugger, Mike partners to create impact through a variety of conflict management, people development, facilitation, change enablement, visual storytelling, restorative justice, and organizational development practices and workshops. Together these approaches seek to build a community of support, make things discussable, draw out options for exploration, provide for agency, and empower people.</p>
