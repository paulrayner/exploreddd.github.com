        <h2>Hands-On Session</h2>
        <h2 class="gold">Architecture Modernization: Understanding your System's Current State using Service Blueprints</h2>
        <p>When attempting to modernize an existing system, you need to build up an understanding of how the business works and the complexities of the existing system in order to answer questions such as:</p>
        <h3>Where do we start?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>What are the pain points and risks associated with the existing system?</li>
          <li>How can we incrementally modernize the system?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Service Blueprints allow you to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Help understand the big picture of the system and can serve as a foundation for using other techniques like Value Stream Mapping, EventStorming, etc and other domain-driven analysis methods.</li>
          <li>Help build a shared understanding of the system among the different teams that are responsible for fulfilling a business capability</li>
          <li>Create a repeatable and structured way that is remote friendly and collaborative to understand the complexity of your domain.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What youâ€™ll learn:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>What are Service Blueprints?</li>
          <li>How to use them effectively to understand the current state of your system in a hands-on exercise?</li>
          <li>How is it different from BigPicture Eventstorming?</li>
          <li>What are some other methods you could potentially explore with Service Blueprints as a foundation?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Who should attend:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Engineering and Product people who need to learn a new domain quickly
          <li>Developers, Team Leads, and Architects wondering how to modernize their existing system and where to start.
          <li>Developers and Team Leads who want to introduce Visual Modeling techniques to their team to help understand the current state of an existing system.
        </ul>
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Your Laptop. </li>
          <li>We will be using Figjam. Figjam is a whiteboard tool similar to Miro for collaboration. A Figjam account is NOT needed. The advantage of using Figjam is that when you complete this workshop and return to the real world of working remotely, you can continue using the templates and the format instead of the post-it notes that may be lost forever in the workshop. We will also be collaborating using sticky notes and flip charts. </li>
          <li>Previous knowledge of DDD is NOT required</li>
          <li>Experience using visual collaboration techniques is NOT required</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Hands-On Session</h2>
        <h2 class="gold">Architecture Modernization: Portfolio Prioritization, Planning, and Strategy</h2>
        <h3>Co-Presented with <a href="nick-tune.html">Nick Tune</a></h3>
        <p>One of the most fundamental and difficult aspects of an architecture modernization initiative is determining how much, and how, to invest in each area of the portfolio. In highly differentiating core domains, we want to invest heavily to fully exploit the potential, whereas in less critical domains we want to reduce costs for the minimum effort.</p>
        <p>In this hands-on session, you'll get to play with proven collaborative techniques for taking a portfolio perspective and making strategic portfolio choices to ensure your modernization investments deliver the greatest returns.</p>
