       <span class="speaker-subtitle">Independent Consultant - contextualizing DDD, systems leadership & sociotechnical architecture</span>
       <p><a class="speaker-handle" href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@xinyao" target="_blank">@xinyao@mathstodon.xyz</a></p>
       <p>Xin is an independent consultant and speaker in international conferences. An avid practitioner of sociotechnical architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Xin nudges organizations at crossroads to move beyond seeing architecture as an upfront design blueprint. She is deeply committed to engaging collective reasoning and aspiration to build and evolve architecture as scaffolding for in-the-moment coherence, and for navigating the ever shapeshifting, multi-dimensional complexity we are all swimming in.</p>
        <p>She architects collaborative design experiences in scale-ups and enterprises to unravel complexity and discover leverage points in software-centric strategy deployment. She’s spearheaded large-scale change initiatives in boundary-spanning roles, weaving together strategy, products, teams, systems and domains in reflective conversations to guide progress and reduce stress.</p>
        <p>In sociotechnical environments where a team’s cognitive capacity is under constant stress, she practices domain-driven design and facilitates collaborative modeling to help agile teams and organizations make sense, make decisions and make intuitive business software</p>

        <h2 class="gold">Incubating systems leadership with DDD and friends</h2>
       <p>In our industry, old and new software multiplies at dizzying speed to eat the world. Yet the world is a big mouthful of multi-dimensional complexity. As software decisions, product and business decisions, teaming and reteaming decisions interweave in webs of interdependencies, this software-laden world is hungering for systems leaders. 
        <p>The plural “systems” alludes to /systems thinking/ and /system of systems/. Systems leaders are those with the ability to see the larger system, to foster reflective conversations and facilitate collaborative design, and to shift the collective focus from reactive problem solving to co-creating a future which hold our deepest aspirations. Systems leaders help us navigate sociotechnical complexity, inspire our commitment and focus our energy.  </p>
        <p>But who are these systems leaders? Where and how do they get the magical leadership skills? Are great systems leaders born or made?      </p>
        <p>Buckminster Fuller once said: “If you want to teach people a new way of thinking, don't bother trying to teach them. Instead, give them a tool, the use of which will lead to new ways of thinking.” </p>
        <p>On a similar note, I have experienced in a visceral way in the past decade, how working with DDD and its adjacent possible practices (what I call “DDD and friends”) has been developmental in my own systems leadership capacity, even without me intending or noticing it in the first place.</p>
        <p>When I look back at my own learning trajectory and that of many fellow DDD architects or enthusiasts, there is something in the DDD philosophy and mindset, which nudges us forward toward systems thinking and contextual understanding. </p>
        <p>When starting to explore DDD, it doesn’t take us long to realize that DDD is a team sport. And since DDD is software-centric by birth, DDD practice tends to be where the technical (i.e. software) and the social (i.e. people and organizations creating and using the software) motivate the practitioners to think across boundaries and think together.    </p>
        <p>In this talk, I will share my own developmental journeys, DDD experiences as well as broader observations of other DDD practitioners to venture a daring hypothesis: DDD holds a tremendous potential for incubating systems leaders. Systems leaders with or without formal authority to catalyze and guide systemic change at a scale commensurate with the scale of complexity we face. After all, when things get complex, we depend on each other to succeed. Through practice, we learn to create a space where people come together to tell the truth of their view of the reality, think more deeply about the problem space and solution space, explore options and alternative models beyond superficial thinking, and search for higher leverage changes through progressive cycles of action and reflection and learning over time.</p>
        <p>I will highlight a few thinking, modeling and conversational tools that have been particularly transformational in my own DDD journey, both when I was an internal change agent in a large financial company and in the last couple of years as an independent DDD consultant. </p>
        <p>I wish to propose that systems leadership is a set of learnable skills. Looping back to the Buckminster Fuller quote -  all learning is doing. All skills come from practice. The hindsight I am sharing in this talk is what I wish someone would have told me a decade ago when I first started my own DDD expedition. It might have saved me some detours, sleepless nights and existential crises.   </p>
