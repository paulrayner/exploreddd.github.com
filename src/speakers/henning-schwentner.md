        <h2>Hands-On Session</h2>
        <h2 class="gold">Domain Storytelling—Understanding Your Users by Drawing Pictures</h2>
        <p>Misunderstandings between developers and the business are a plague. Bad communication makes projects fail. This talk presents a remedy. The session's highlight will be a practical demonstration with the auditorium as an interview partner.</p>
        <p>Domain Storytelling is a technique to transform domain knowledge into effective business software. It brings together domain experts and development teams to: (a) understand the domain of a software system, (b) find microservices boundaries, and (c) talk about requirements.</p>
        <p>We let domain experts tell us stories about their tasks. While listening, we record the stories using an easy-to-understand pictographic language.</p>
        <p>The domain experts can see immediately whether we understand their story correctly. After very few stories, we are able to talk about the people, processes, and events in that domain.</p>
        <p>The talk is aimed at everyone involved or interested in software development, including non-technical people.</p>
