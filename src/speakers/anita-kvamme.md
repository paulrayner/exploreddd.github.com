        <h2 class="gold">DDD and Event Sourcing in Action: Insights from Two Real-Life Projects</h2>
        <p>As a hands-on coding software architect, I have had the pleasure to work with multiple solutions where we have applied DDD & BDD in event sourced applications. </p>
        <p>In this talk I will share my experience both focusing on what has been hard and what has been surprisingly easy.</p>
        <p>Come and join my talk to hear more about</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How does the event focus in Event Sourcing and the usage of domain model and read models impact our domain modelling (compared to </li>none event sourced application).
            <li>The lessons learned when using BDD for shaping the domain model in our event sourced applications.</li>
            <li>Why we use domain classes in our events and how that impact our migration strategy.</li>
            <li>Reactors - the most powerful building block, but at the same time the one thing that have given us the hardest challenges.</li>
            <li>How to handle that our application is a complex arrangement of simple parts, and how to avoid it to become a complex arrangement of complex parts.</li>
