        <h2 class="gold">Rebuilding an Architecture Practice via DDD</h2>
       <p>Hagerty has traditionally had an enterprise architecture group responsible for magically solving problems by etching them into a stone tablet and throwing them out of the Ivory tower. Since joining the organization and taking over its architecture team, I've used DDD principles to change roles, titles, culture, and defined architectural success at Hagerty to the point where even executives understand its value more deeply. This presentation is a case study in the journey we've been on at Hagerty, our triumphs and pitfalls so far, and the road ahead using this growing support and momentum.</p>
