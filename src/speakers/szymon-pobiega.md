       <p>Szymon works an engineer at Particular Software, the makers of NServiceBus. His main areas of expertise are Domain-Driven Design and asynchronous messaging. He is especially interested in the intersection of these two topics -- in the patterns and tools for ensuring all messages are processed exactly once and in the correct order.</p>
        <p>Szymon is a co-author of <a href="https://exactly-once.github.io" target="_blank">https://exactly-once.github.io</a>, a website dedicated to all things related to messaging.</p>

In his free time Szymon plays with Lego, building models of real-life off-road vehicles.</p>
       <h2>Hands-On Session</h2>
        <h2 class="gold">Exactly-once: the holy grail of distributed systems</h2>
       <p>Imagine a world in which you could build a distributed system that guarantees that every individual user action travels throughout a multitude of services without ever being lost or duplicated. No lost orders. No duplicate entries that require reviews. No persistent exceptions due to data inconsistencies. </p>
        <p>If you're imagining rainbows and unicorns right now, this session is for you!</p>
        <p>Before going into specifics, we need to stop thinking about message delivery and focus on message processing instead. We'll explore an end-to-end approach to message processing, starting from the human-to-machine interaction in the front end of the system and traversing component-to-component message-based communication throughout the system.</p>
        <p>As a cherry on top, I'll present you with a fully operable example showcasing cross-system, exactly-once, HTTP-based communication.</p>
        <p>Ready to explore what's over the rainbow?</p>
