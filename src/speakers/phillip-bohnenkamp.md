        <h2 class="gold">Harnessing ChatGPT for Domain-Driven Design: Is There Potential for AI in Domain Modeling?</h2>
       <p>Large language models like ChatGPT, though still in their infancy, are increasingly demonstrating their usefulness in general software development. In this session, we go beyond general software development and investigate the potential of ChatGPT specifically with regard to domain-driven design and domain model distillation. We will critically assess the capabilities of ChatGPT, its capacity to understand complex domains and a team's ubiquitous language, and the value it may provide to both domain experts and developers. Through practical examples and case studies, we will examine whether integrating ChatGPT into the domain-driven design process can lead to more accurate, efficient, and effective system design. By exploring the role of AI in domain modeling, this presentation seeks to inspire a meaningful dialogue on the collaboration between human expertise and machine learning in the ever-evolving landscape of software development.</p>
