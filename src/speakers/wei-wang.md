       <h2>Hands-On Session</h2>
        <h2 class="gold">Gardening Legacy Modernization: Cultivating Success with the Cynefin Framework and Estuarine Map</h2>
        <h3>Co-Presented with <a href="zhen-goh.html">Zhen Goh</a></h3>
        <p>Welcome to our hands-on workshop on "Utilizing Estuarine Maps to Facilitate Legacy Modernization." In this session, we will delve into the effective utilization of Estuarine Maps and the Cynefin Framework to navigate the intricacies involved in modernizing legacy systems.
        <p>Across various industries, numerous businesses rely on outdated legacy software systems. These systems have been developed over a prolonged period, often without proper governance or best practices in place. Consequently, these legacy systems accumulate significant technical debt, making modifications and updates challenging. Furthermore, their inability to integrate with modern technologies hampers enterprises from harnessing the potential of these advancements to enhance operational efficiency.</p>
        <p>The Cynefin framework and Estuarine Map, developed by Professor Dave Snowden, offer decision makers scientific tools to improve their work. The Cynefin framework is an award-winning contextual awareness and decision-making framework that helps us to identify the right approach to problems. Estuarine mapping begins with identifying the constraints and constructors within our systems, and mapping them against a time x energy axis to identify the constraints that we can take effective action on to actively manage them.</p>
        <p>The primary goal of this hands-on workshop is to incorporate these methods into the Legacy Modernization framework. Instead of solely concentrating on technical strategies, the workshop will utilize Cynefin and Estuarine Map as tools to cultivate an environment that promotes the long-term success of the modernization process within the organization. Furthermore, the approach will emphasize the importance of preventing the creation of additional legacy systems throughout this journey.</p>
        <p>In this workshop, we will:</p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Introduce Estuarine Map and Cynefin framework basics.</li>
            <li>Using a concrete example, with comprehensive data set from software design context, demonstrate the process of creating modernization affordance with the Estuarine Map.</li>
            <li>Use the Cynefin framework to create strategic initiatives for addressing complex problems.</li>
            <li>Encourage group discussions and problem-solving.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Our goal is to equip you with the tools and perspective needed to navigate legacy system modernization efficiently. Let's start this journey together and discover how the Estuarine Map and  Cynefin Framework can guide your modernization strategy. Thank you for joining us!</p>
