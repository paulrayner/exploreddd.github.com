       <p>Tobias started his career as a freelance web developer in the late 90s and has since worked on hundreds of projects of varying sizes and lengths - from a single person to multiple teams, from a few days to several years - and in many different roles: Consultant, crafter, coach, and... well, architect. He is a strong advocate of diversity and inclusion in the tech industry, and an active member of the European Software Crafters and Domain Driven Design communities.</p>

        <h2 class="gold">Domain Driven Design in the Cloud - and Beyond</h2>
       <p>When Eric Evans wrote the Blue Book, he could not have foreseen cloud computing, infrastructure as code, and managed services.</p>
       <p>Many of the original tactical DDD patterns at first glance seem inadequate, and strangely misplaced in cloud native environments. Even microservices, strongly tied to bounded contexts, no longer seem inevitable, as the industry standard shifts to serverless, low-/no-code tools, and generative AI.</p>
       <p>How much of DDD is still relevant? Can the same heuristics guide us through a different landscape? A story about finding boundaries in a strange new world.</p>
