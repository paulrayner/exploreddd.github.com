        <h2 class="gold">BAPO üíús DDD: How System Design Enables Better Org Design</h2>
        <p>Conways Law - the concept that your product resembles your org structure - is a double-edged sword. If your organization is intentionally structured to optimize your strengths, it‚Äôs great!</p>
        <p>However, oftentimes organizations are the result of unintentional design, leading to accidental complexity and inability to maximize results.  Even when organizations are intentionally designed, they can optimize the wrong things - such as command and control - leading to clunky outcomes.  Why does this happen? Is it preventable? How can you tell if this is happening in your organization?!</p>
        <p>The short answer is: YES!</p>
        <p>In my current role as the Director of Engineering for our billion-dollar ads business, I and my team have been given the unique opportunity to redesign our organization for speed, collaboration and results.</p>
        <p>We decided to put our principles into practice by using two system design principles to organize our 100-person team who support our hundreds of components:</p> 
        <ul>
          <li>DDD (Domain Driven Design): ‚Äúa software development philosophy centered around the domain, or sphere of knowledge, of those that use it‚Äù
          <li>BAPO (Business Architecture Process Organization): Jan Bosch‚Äôs expression of strategic organization design</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Join me to discuss this real-world case and how it fared!</p>
