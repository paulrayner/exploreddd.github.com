        <p>Eric Evans is the author of <em>Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in Software</em>, Addison-Wesley 2004.</p>
        <p>Since the early 1990s, he has worked on many projects developing large business systems with objects with many different approaches and many different outcomes. The book is a synthesis of that experience. It presents a system of modeling and design techniques that successful teams have used to align complex software systems with business needs and to keep projects agile as systems grow large.</p>
        <p>Eric now leads Domain Language, a consulting group which coaches and trains teams applying domain-driven design, helping them to make their development work more productive and more valuable to their business.</p>
             <h2>Opening Keynote</h2>
        <h2 class="gold">Large Language Models (LLMS) and Software Design</h2>
        <p>Eric Evans, author of Domain Driven Design, will be opening the conference by asking how large language models (LLMs) might be a tool for cultivating deep domain understanding? Beyond the hype, how they might be used in our work of developing software that helps people operating in complex domains?</p>
        <p>Is there a future where language models are not just tools but indispensable companions in unraveling the intricacies of the business landscape, and how might we shape that?</p>
