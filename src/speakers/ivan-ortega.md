       <p>After six years of working on dashboarding products for New Relic and Grafana, I became extremely enthusiastic about frontend technologies. I also have a passion for AI. Initially, I believed AI was solely for backend specialists. Fortunately, this assumption proved wrong, and I've spent the past year delving into this area, learning how to integrate AI into user interfaces, yielding unexpectedly remarkable results.</p>
       <h2>Hands-On Session</h2>
        <h2 class="gold">LLMs Introduction: What they are and how to leverage them</h2>
        <h3>Co-Presented with <a href="nathan-marrs.html">Nathan Marrs</a></h3>
       <p>Join Nathan and Ivan in this hands-on session where you will first learn at a high level what large language models (LLMs) are and how they work. Then dive into an interactive coding exercise where you will implement LLM functionality into a basic example application. During this exercise you will get a feel for key skills for working with LLMs in your own applications such as prompt engineering and exposure to OpenAI's API.</p>
        <p>After this session you will have insights around what LLMs are and how they can practically be used to improve your own applications.</p>
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
