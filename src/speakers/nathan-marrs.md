       <h2>Hands-On Session</h2>
<h2 class="gold">LLMs Introduction: What they are and how to leverage them</h2>
       <p>Join Nathan in this hands-on session where you will first learn at a high level what large language models (LLMs) are and how they work. Then dive into an interactive coding exercise where you will implement LLM functionality into a basic example application. During this exercise you will get a feel for key skills for working with LLMs in your own applications such as prompt engineering and exposure to OpenAI's API.</p>
        <p>After this session you will have insights around what LLMs are and how they can practically be used to improve your own applications.</p>
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Will provide code samples / environment to run demo in (whether web based or a public GitHub repo)</li>
            <li>Basic knowledge of ML / AI space will be beneficial</li>
