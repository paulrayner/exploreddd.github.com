        <h2 class="gold">Why Working with Product is Hard</h2>
       <p>As an technologist, your goal is to make useful software ready for release.  You even may be "Agile," and use Event Storming with a cross-functional team of to create the ability to deploy working code in iterations.  Even so, meaningful collaborations with Product Owners and Product Managers are usually a challenge. Often these roles only show up only just before a release or when there is a customer-facing error.  This behavior leaves the team, solving the problem of how to prioritize their work for the maximum benefit to customerrs, users, and organization.  Getting this wrong can lead to re-work or costly product failure. This lack of engagement is a wide-spread problem that seems to have gotten even worse in recent years. Why?</p>
        <p>This lively workshop will reveal three key causes of this this lack of Product engagement.  Participants will also be introduced to Product Thinking tools such as OKRs and User Story Mapping that tend to get better engagement from Product Managers and Organizational Leadership at large.  You will go home with practical tips for fostering valuable conversations with Product and other roles who desperately need to understand the importance of collaboration.</p>
