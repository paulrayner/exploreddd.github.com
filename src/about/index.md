		<h3>Our conference mission is simple and straightforward:</h3>

			<li>Build awareness of software modeling and design amongst the broader software development community</li>
			<li>Assemble the best industry-recognized experts</li>

		<h3>What is the conference Code of Conduct?</h3>
		<p><i>We aim to provide a safe learning experience for all conference participants, and thus expect them to be kind and respectful towards others. We embrace diversity of human experience and the strength it brings to our communities and relationships.</i></p>
		<p>We care deeply about making Explore DDD a safe and welcoming space for everyone. In light of this, all attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will model and reinforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.</p>
		<p>If you have any questions, or are harassed in any way, please notify a conference staff member. All reports are confidential.</p>
		<h3>The Quick Version</h3>
		<p>Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.</p>
		<h3>The Less Quick Version</h3>
		<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
		<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>
		<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>
		<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff or one of the code of conduct first responders immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing staff lanyards. You can email contact@exploreddd.com. All reports are confidential.</p>
		<p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance. We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events. Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all!</p>

		<h3>What about diversity?</h3>
		<p>We are seeking to source and support speakers from underrepresented groups as much as possible in order to provide a richly diverse lineup of perspectives and backgrounds.</p>
