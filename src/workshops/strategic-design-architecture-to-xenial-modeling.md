            <h1>Strategic Design: Architecture to Xenial Modeling</h1>
            <p><span class="speaker-name"><a href="../speakers/vaughn-vernon.html">Vaughn Vernon</a></span>
            <span class="duration">2-Day Workshop<br>Tue-Wed, Mar 12-13</span></p>
            <p>Strategic design is the most broadly applicable of the Domain-Driven Design toolset, and its use is vital. Without a deep understanding of differentiating strategy driven by business knowledge among all stakeholders, software is nothing more than the interpretations of programmers. Their guesswork follows layers of previous requirements interpretations passed down the business hierarchy. Are guesswork and individual interpretations what businesses want? Without certain effort to engage with business leaders, even the most skilled software leaders are ill-suited to deliver true strategic results.</p>
            <p>Along with vital strategy, architecture is critically important to all software systems. Yet, with an over emphasis on technology, two-thirds of the critical software architecture influences is missing from the equation. To make architecture add up requires 360 xenial behavior and activities among the entirety of stakeholders. The adjective "xenial" describes key behaviors that include: friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers. The key is friendly collaboration with those who are often considered strangers within the same organization. This highlights the need for a fusion of all three architectural influences: business, social, and technical.</p>
