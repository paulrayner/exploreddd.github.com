                <p>Organizations face more and more complexity these days as a result of a mesh of products, services, technology, and the people that work to build, operate, and maintain them.</p>
                <p>Domain-Driven Design helps us with solving problems the right way. But what helps us solve the right problem? How can we continuously validate our progress with people in "non-tech" roles? And what should we do when the world around us changes, which it always ends up doing? Is the plan we had still valid?</p>

                <h2>Imagine...</h2>
                <p>Imagine having a map that helps you understand the ecosystem your organization is embedded in. A map that makes sense from both a technical and business perspective. With patterns that provide guidance about effective actions regardless of the specific domain you are working in. Wardley Mapping is that: it is a ubiquitous language around strategy and execution that helps you solve the right problem.</p>
                <h2>The course</h2>
                <p>In this course, you will learn to map your business and technological landscape in such a way that a common language emerges to discuss strategic thinking and decision making. It allows for scenario building, it teaches about bias and assumptions, and it comes packaged with a long list of ideas that may help in your situation.</p>
                <p>The map can hint to us what practices from DDD are beneficial in our situation. And it can serve as a context map too, except this one has meaning to business people as well.</p>
                <p>Using visualizations, strategies can be challenged and implementation options debated and weighed. As such, mapping is about the act and not merely the artifact. That is why this training is hands-on from the very start.</p>
                <h2>What to expect</h2>
                <img src="../img/workshop/Workshop-Marijn-Huizendveld-2.jpg" class="speaker--workshop-content-img" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 30px;" />
                <p>This class will emphasize practice over theory. Mapping with imperfect knowledge today is better than mapping with perfect knowledge next year. The course will teach you the basics and provide hooks into the theoretical aspects behind exercises.</p>
                <h2>Who should attend</h2>
                <p>Anyone that wants to challenge the status quo of decision-making under uncertainty in technology and business. No prior knowledge is required and your open attitude to learn new things will be an asset during the workshop.</p>
                </p>
