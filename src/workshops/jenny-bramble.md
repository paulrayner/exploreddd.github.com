                <h1>Making and Managing Mind Maps</h1>
                <p><span class="speaker-name">Jenny Bramble</span>
                <span class="duration">March 22, 2021<br>9:00 AM - 12:00 PM (MDT)</span></p>
                <p>Organizing complex thoughts on a topic can be a challenge, especially if the topic has many different directions you can take it.  It can be challenging to keep everything straight and follow the threads that are most important.</p>
                <p>Mind maps are an organizational tool that lets you group similar thoughts and find links between them.  They can be used to investigate test cases and test plans, create personas, work through presentations, and more!</p>
                <p>Join Jenny Bramble for a dive into the history of mind maps, some modern tools, and some interesting use cases like menu creation for a restaurant, settings pages for an app, or creating presentations.  Participants can expect to create mind maps collaboratively with the group on a range of topics as well as learning good mind map practices using colors, images, and other rich media.</p>

                <div class="speaker-img-in-content jenny-bramble keep-color"></div>
                <p>Jenny came up through support and DevOps, cutting her teeth on that interesting role that acts as the 'translator' between customer requests from support and the development team before diving headlong into her career as a tester. Her love of support and the human side of problems lets her find a sweet spot between empathy for the user and empathy for her team. She's done testing, support, or human interfacing for most of her career. She finds herself happiest when she's making an impact on other people––whether it's helping find issues in applications, speaking at events, or just grabbing coffee and chatting.</p>
