                <h1>Domain Modeling Made Functional</h1>
                <p><span class="speaker-name">Scott Wlaschin</span>
                <span class="duration">October 27-30, 2020<br>9:30 AM - 12:30 PM (MDT)</span></p>
                <p>Functional programming and domain-driven design might not seem to be a good match, but in fact functional programming can be an excellent approach to designing decoupled,  reusable systems with a rich domain model. This workshop will show you why.</p>
                <p>This will be a hands-on workshop designed for beginners in functional programming. We'll do lots of exercises and build some small projects that take us all the way from high-level design to low-level implementation.</p>
                <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
                <p>This workshop is aimed at software developers and it will be especially useful if you are learning functional programming â€“ all concepts used in the workshop will be explained. Previous development experience is recommended. No prior knowledge of functional programming required.</p>
                <h2>What you'll learn</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The concepts of functional programming</li>
                    <li>How to represent the nouns and verbs of a domain using types and functions</li>
                    <li>How to decouple the pure domain logic from the outside world</li>
                    <li>How to ensure that constraints and business rules are captured in the design</li>
                    <li>How to represent state transitions in the domain model</li>
                    <li>How to build a business workflow from smaller components</li>
                    <li>How to handle errors as part of the domain</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By the end of the workshop you'll know how to build working solutions with rich domain models, using only functional programming techniques.</p>
