                <p>EventStorming is a workshop format that promotes collaboration between different disciplines in order to sove business problems in the most effective way.</p>
                <p>In this two day format we’ll experience the different formats, working around real business problems.
                We’ll take into account the different perspectives (including the facilitator) in a process that spans large scale discovery, to leverage collaborative design.
                We’ll experience the how, and we’ll discuss the why.</p>

                <p><strong>Day 1</strong></p>
                <p>EventStorming as a discovery tool.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Quick kick-off: where are we and where we want to go.</li>
                    <li>Real world Big Picture EventStorming, mastering complexity and unknowns in large scale modeling.</li>
                    <li>Managing conflicts, highlighting risk, and the problems really worth solving. The facilitator’s toolbox revealed.</li>
                    <li>Improving our process exploring motivations of different actors.</li>
                    <li>The Change agent’s perspective: why it’s going to be hard even when improvement is obvious, and how to deal with stalemates.</li>
                    <li>Everything’s connected: lean &amp; Kanban, complexity and organization limits.</li>
                    <li>Working with startups vs. working with established companies. </li>
                    <li>EventStorming as a platform for problem solving.</li>
                    <li>ModelStorming: modeling everything without a clue (and yet deliver).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Day 2</strong></p>

                <h2>Alberto Brandolini Biography</h2>
                <p>Alberto Brandolini can model every business domain, given enough space, a paper roll and an unlimited source of colored sticky notes (with a larger stock of orange ones). His contributions to the community include EventStorming, Model Storming and, more notably, the Bullshit Asymmetry Principle.</p>
                <p>Alberto Brandolini is an IT Professional that gets bored doing things in the same old way. This led him into unexplored areas of Domain-Driven Design, Lean and Agile Software Development, learning and change management, where he likes to bring apparent chaotic fuzziness and a comic-like visual touch. An active consultant in software product development, he also runs his company Avanscoperta.</p>
                <p>He’s frequently invited as a speaker in many conferences in Italy (where he’s based) and around Europe.</p>
                <h2>Paul Rayner Biography</h2>

His company <a href="https://www.virtualgenius.com/" target="_blank">Virtual Genius LLC</a>, provides training and coaching in DDD for agile teams.
