            <span class="duration">2-Day Workshop<br>Tue-Wed, Mar 12-13</span></p>
            <p>EventStorming is a workshop format that enables massive learning on complex business domains and promotes collaboration between disciplines and teams.</p>
            <p>The modeling and visualization techniques are versatile and can be used successfully to discover current or future scenarios or to design solutions collaboratively.</p>
            <h2>Agenda</h2>
            <h3>Day 1 – EventStorming as a Discovery Tool</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Quick kick-off: where we are and where we want to go</li>
                <li>Real-world Big Picture EventStorming, mastering complexity and unknowns in large-scale modeling</li>
                <li>Managing conflicts, highlighting risk, and the problems worth solving</li>
                <li>The facilitator’s toolbox revealed</li>
                <li>Improving our process exploring motivations of different actors</li>
                <li>The Change agent’s perspective: why it’s going to be hard even when improvement is obvious, and how to deal with stalemates</li>
                <li>Everything’s connected: Lean & Kanban, complexity and organization limits</li>
                <li>Working with startups vs. working with established companies</li>
                <li>EventStorming as a platform for problem-solving</li>
                <li>ModelStorming: modeling everything without a clue (and yet delivering amazing insights).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Day 2 – Using EventStorming to Design a System</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Emerging System Boundaries: from EventStorming to Bounded Contexts</li>
                <li>Process Modelling EventStorming: a cross-discipline platform for collaborative modeling</li>

                <li>Making policies explicit. Discovering the hidden truth in business behavior</li>
                <li>Design around Value: hidden and explicit motivators</li>
                <li>Software Design EventStorming: discovering key software components</li>
                <li>Aggregates and transactional consistency: independent moving parts in a large system</li>
                <li>Design around the bottleneck: changing the rules of the game</li>
                <li>Blending User Experience Design and Service Design into Software Design</li>
                <li>Triggering bullet-proof design with visible state</li>
                <li>The transaction illusion</li>
                <li>From sticky notes to working software. When to go for sophisticated architecture.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What You Will Learn</h2>
            <p>In this two-day EventStorming Masterclass with Alberto Brandolini, we’ll practice three different flavors (Big Picture, Process Modelling and Software Design), applied to real-world business problems.</p>
            <p>We’ll take into account the different perspectives (including the facilitator) in a process that spans large-scale discovery, to leverage collaborative design.</p>
            <p>We’ll experience the how, and we’ll discuss the why.</p>
            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <p>EventStorming is interdisciplinary. The specialistic notation is dropped in favor of an incremental lo-fi approach that allows an inclusive approach while driving the exploration towards the most sensitive areas. Every participant will actively contribute.</p>
