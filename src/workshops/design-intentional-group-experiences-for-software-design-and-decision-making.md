            <span class="duration">2-Day Workshop<br>Tue-Wed, Mar 12-13</span></p>
            <p>This workshop supports anyone who has the responsibility of bringing groups together for collaborative activities such as software design, modeling or decision-making. You’ll solve the common problems you experience when running group work in your context by leveraging 16 Design Aspects.</p>
            <p>The 16 Design Aspects have been developed from Dan Young and Mike Rozinsky’s experience coaching individuals as well as designing and delivering experiences for groups of 3 to 800 people - online, in-person, and spaces in between. In this session, you will work alongside Dan and Mike as well as your peers to design, prepare and facilitate software design and decision-making sessions for any size group and any type of space.</p>
            <p>Dan and Mike invite you to join them to further your group-work design practice by thinking more deeply about how to be intentional in the way you bring people together to design software.</p>
            <p>To get the most out of the workshop, please bring something to take notes in and ideally a laptop or other device to access online materials and resources.</p>
