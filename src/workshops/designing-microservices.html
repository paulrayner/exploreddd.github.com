         <h1>Designing Microservices: Responsibilities, APIs and Collaborations</h1>
         <p><span class="speaker-name">Chris Richardson</span>
         <span class="duration">2-Day Workshop<br>Mon-Tue, Sept 21-22</span></p>
         <p><strong>Learn a structured, collaborative process for defining a microservice architecture that enables fast flow.</strong></p>
         <p>GenAI-based coding agents dramatically increase the rate of change, making fast flow even more essential. The microservice architecture enables that flow at scale, and well-designed service boundaries act as guardrails for coding agents, containing complexity and limiting technical debt. Yet it is far too easy to get service boundaries wrong and create a fragile distributed monolith where teams are tightly coupled; services change in lockstep; deployments are risky; autonomy is an illusion; and fast flow becomes systemic friction.</p>
         <p>In this workshop, Chris Richardson presents a structured, collaborative process for defining a microservice architecture that enables fast flow. Through lectures and guided discussions, you will learn how to design microservices with clear responsibilities, well-defined APIs, and explicit collaboration patterns. In hands-on modeling exercises, you will apply the process using a GenAI-assisted architect's workbench that accelerates architecture exploration and refinement while reinforcing disciplined design thinking.</p>

         <h2 class="speaker-subheader">How it works</h2>
         <p>This workshop combines lectures, guided discussions, and hands-on modeling exercises. You will apply the design process using a GenAI-assisted architect's workbench that accelerates architecture exploration and refinement while reinforcing disciplined design thinking.</p>
         <h2 class="speaker-subheader">FAQ</h2>
         <p><strong>What level of experience do I need?</strong></p>
         <p>This is an intermediate-level workshop. Familiarity with microservices concepts and distributed systems is helpful.</p>
         <p><strong>Should I bring my laptop?</strong></p>
         <p>Yes. You will need a laptop for the hands-on modeling exercises.</p>
         <p><strong>What should I wear?</strong></p>
         <p>Informal. Wear comfortable shoes as some of the activities involve moving around.</p>
