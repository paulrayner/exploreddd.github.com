                <p>How might we make an indispensable product out of a painful problem? Who's going to be there and what is going to be the desired outcome?</p>
                <p>Human-Centred Design (HCD) is the collection of different methods and approaches to bring out the discipline of developing solutions in the service of people. Introducing these design methods in software development essentially helps you design like a user for a user and not design like a developer for the user which is a miss-match and leads to creating a huge user-product divide.</p>
                <h2>WHAT YOU WILL LEARN</h2>
                <p>This workshop has been organized by way of three key design skills: Looking, understanding and making.</p>
                <h3>Looking:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Innovation begins and ends with people which calls for keen and caring observation.
                        <ul>
                            <li>You will learn how to use HCD to carefully investigate if there is a need for the product being planned.</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>How might you use curiosity, objectivity and empathy to engage all of your senses in pursuit of meaningful findings?</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Understanding:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Innovation isn't a lightbulb moment of genius. It calls for deep understanding and rigorous discernment.
                        <ul>
                            <li>You will learn how to use HCD to revolutionize critical thinking and problem framing.</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>How might you identify patterns, determine priorities, and translate your research into actionable insights?</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Making:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Innovation puts great ideas in action. It calls for making things happen in a resourceful and resonant manner.
                        <ul>
                            <li>You will learn how to incorporate imaginative and visual expression in HCD to precedes successful improvement through frequent iteration.</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>How might you think with your hands to bring new ideas to life?</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>WORKSHOP FORMAT</h2>
                <p>Interactive learnings and group assignments.</p>
                <h2>WORKSHOP SCHEDULE</h2>

                <p>Methods of observing human experience.</p>
                <p>Understanding ethnographic, participatory and evaluative research and how HCD can be leveraged for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stepping out of your native environment to learn what people do in their abode to spur Innovation.</li>
                    <li>Paying close attention to discover critical and latent needs to offer solutions people don't even know they need.</li>
                    <li>Assessing the usefulness and usability of the solutions meant to serve people.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Understanding the relationship between people & systems, pattern & priorities and problem framing to ensure accuracy of:
                    <ul>
