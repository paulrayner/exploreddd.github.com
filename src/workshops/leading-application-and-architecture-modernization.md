            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>As a Technology leader entrusted with modernizing your systems, you have to deal with some or all of these aspects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hard to evolve legacy systems: There is a risk that you will fall behind in the market as other companies are able to develop better products</li>
                <li>Inefficient Development & Excessive Costs: A majority of the time is spent on keeping the lights on instead of experimenting on new things that are needed for the business</li>
                <li>Poor Developer Experience: Developers struggle to work with big ball of mud type systems on a regular day-in and day-out basis</li>
                <li>Lottery Factor: Only a handful of people know the old system well, and if they retire or leave the company, it puts at risk the business revenue and keeping the systems running</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please note: This isn't a workshop about refactoring legacy code and does not cover any programming or infrastructure technologies.</p>
            <h2>What you'll learn:</h2>
            <p>Over two full days, this workshop covers the diverse range of topics that leaders and practitioners need to successfully modernize their systems, from strategy to execution:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Why modernization is needed, and how to spot the signs that modernization will benefit your organization</li>
                <li>Modernization is more than a technology upgrade- it's a chance to modernize the UX, domain model, and the domain as well as requiring collaboration between many disciplines like product, tech, UX, and more</li>
                <li>Analyzing the current state and identifying modernization opportunities using Domain-Driven Analysis techniques like Service Blueprints</li>
                <li>Defining a modernization strategy connected to the business strategy and product north stars with techniques like Wardley Mapping</li>
                <li>Designing a future architecture vision with a domain-driven approach</li>
                <li>Portfolio-driven modernization: identifying the optimal modernization investment approach in each part of your system</li>
                <li>Migration and roadmaps: Planning the journey from the current state to future vision using patterns like the bubble context and strangler fig</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Throughout the workshop you'll experience a mix of hands-on activities, lectures, and group conversations. You'll get to hear from other attendees and share your own unique modernization experiences and challenges.</p>
            <h2>Who should attend:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Senior leaders who define the modernization strategy such as Engineering Director and Product Directors</li>
                <li>Engineering Managers and Coaches who facilitate modernization</li>
                <li>Consultants who regularly work with clients to help them on their modernization journey</li>
                <li>Principal Engineers, Solution Architects and Tech leads and who are involved in application modernization</li>
                <li>Anyone involved in build vs buy vs outsource decisions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you consider yourself an expert on modernization and are familiar with what's listed in the course contents, this workshop is probably NOT for you.</p>
            <h2>Pre-requisites:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Your Laptop and a free Miro account (miro.com). While doing these exercises collaboratively, we will still use Miro. The advantage of using Miro is that when you complete this workshop and return to the real world of working remotely, you can continue using the templates and the format instead of the post-it notes that may be lost forever in the workshop.</li>
                <li>Previous knowledge of DDD is NOT required</li>
                <li>Experience using visual collaboration techniques is NOT required</li>
            </ul>
