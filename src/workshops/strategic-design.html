         <p>Some design decisions have an impact on the trajectory of the whole project. Modeling is most needed in complex circumstances, yet the typical dynamics of large projects too often derail it or disconnect it from the real design. This course delves into principles for clarifying the big picture, getting effort focused on the core, and coordinating multi-team development.</p>

         <p>This workshop is best suited for participants with experience in large-scale systems and multi-team development. Familiarity with complex software projects will help you fully engage with the content.</p>
         <p><strong>Should I bring my laptop?</strong></p>
         <p>No laptop needed. The workshop is practical but not tool-based. Pen, paper, and your experience are all you need.</p>
