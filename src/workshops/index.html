            <p><span class="speaker-name">Indu Alagarsamy &amp; Nick Tune</span></p>
            <p>As a Technology leader entrusted with modernizing your systems, you have to deal with hard to evolve
               legacy systems, inefficient development &amp; excessive costs, poor developer experience, and lottery
               factor risks. This workshop covers the diverse range of topics that leaders and practitioners need to
               successfully modernize their systems, from strategy to execution.</p>

            <h2>Strategic DDD</h2>
            <p><span class="speaker-name">Eric Evans</span></p>
            <p>Some design decisions have an impact on the trajectory of the whole project. Modeling is most needed in
               complex circumstances, yet the typical dynamics of large projects too often derail it or disconnect it
               from the real design. This course delves into principles for clarifying the big picture, getting effort
               focused on the core, and coordinating multi-team development.</p>

            <h2>Designing Microservices: Responsibilities, APIs and Collaborations</h2>
            <p><span class="speaker-name">Chris Richardson</span></p>
            <p>When applying the microservice architecture pattern, the most important design decisions do not involve
               technology choices. Instead, what's critical to your success is correctly identifying services, defining
               their responsibilities, APIs and collaborations. Through a combination of lectures, discussions, and kata
               exercises, learn how to distill your application's requirements into a collection of loosely coupled,
               appropriately-sized services.</p>

            <p>EventStorming is a workshop format that enables massive learning on complex business domains and promotes
               collaboration between disciplines and teams. The modeling and visualization techniques are versatile and
               can be used successfully to discover current or future scenarios or to design solutions collaboratively.
