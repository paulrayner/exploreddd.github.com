                <h1>An Intro to Boris the Spider and the Swift Method: DDD Techniques for a Modern System</h1>
                <p><span class="speaker-name">Shaun Anderson</span>
                <span class="duration">March 30 - April 2, 2021<br>9:00 AM - 12:30 PM (MDT)</span></p>
                <p>The Swift Method has become a popular technique to use DDD principles to discover how a system really wants to behave.  This method enables teams to get started on complex modernization efforts in days instead of weeks or months.</p>
                <p>In this four day workshop we will explore the Swift Method by modeling a business called We B Foods. Lettuce be honest. Uber Eats is so 2019. We B Foods is a new rapidly growing start-up taking the online food delivery world by storm. We’re nacho typical company!</p>
                <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
                <p>This workshop is aimed at experienced software developers and product owners. Enterprise software development is recommended.</p>

                <h2>What you will learn</h2>
                <p>We will use the radical collaboration of the Swift Method to identify the “real” problems in a large scale application space and discover how to effectively modernize that system.</p>
                <p>Techniques you will be a part of include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Event Storming Light</li>
                    <li>The Boris Exercise</li>
                    <li>Snap-E</li>
                    <li>Applying Tactical Patterns and Solutions</li>
                </ul>
