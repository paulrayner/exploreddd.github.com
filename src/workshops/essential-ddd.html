         <h1>Essential Domain-Driven Design</h1>
         <p><span class="speaker-name">Paul Rayner</span>
         <span class="duration">2-Day Workshop<br>Mon-Tue, Sept 21-22</span></p>
         <p><strong>Get grounded in DDD. Learn what matters, why it matters, and how to apply it.</strong></p>
         <p>Domain-driven design has a reputation for being complex, with layers of patterns, acronyms, and conflicting advice. This workshop cuts through the noise. In two hands-on days, you'll build a solid foundation in the ideas, techniques, and skills that make DDD work in real project contexts.</p>
         <p>Whether you're new to DDD, have read about it but aren't sure how to apply it, or want to bring a shared understanding to your team, this workshop gives you practical tools you can use immediately.</p>
         <h2 class="speaker-subheader">What you will learn</h2>
         <p>By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:</p>
         <ul class="copy-list">
            <li>Identify which business problems benefit most from a DDD approach and where to focus your effort</li>
            <li>Bridge the communication gap between business and technical people using ubiquitous language</li>
            <li>Run collaborative domain discovery sessions using EventStorming with your whole team</li>
            <li>Refactor code to express domain concepts clearly through a ubiquitous language</li>
            <li>Apply key building block patterns for domain modeling in your own codebase</li>
            <li>Use context mapping to guide design decisions across teams and system boundaries</li>
            <li>Pinpoint your core domain and focus investment where it creates the greatest impact</li>
            <li>Choose architectural patterns that support and sustain your domain model</li>
         </ul>
         <h2 class="speaker-subheader">How it works</h2>
         <p>This is a highly interactive, hands-on workshop. You'll work through collaborative exercises, pairing activities, and group discussions, not just listen to lectures. The goal is to connect the pieces of DDD together so you can see what fits, what matters most, and how to take it back to your project.</p>
         <h2 class="speaker-subheader">Who this workshop is for</h2>
         <ul class="copy-list">

            <li>Teams adopting DDD who want a shared foundation</li>
            <li>Practitioners with some DDD exposure who want to fill in gaps and build confidence</li>
