         <h1>Essential Domain-Driven Design</h1>
         <p><span class="speaker-name">Paul Rayner</span>
         <span class="duration">2-Day Workshop<br>Mon-Tue, Sept 21-22</span></p>
         <p>It's easy to get lost in the patterns and acronyms and miss the essence of domain-driven design (DDD). In this workshop you'll gain an understanding of what DDD looks like, why it matters, and how to apply it to you, your team, and your organization.</p>
         <ul class="copy-list">
            <li>Are you new to DDD?</li>
            <li>Struggling to understand what exactly DDD is?</li>
            <li>Feeling overwhelmed by the vast amount of DDD material/advice available?</li>
            <li>Or maybe you're unsure how to apply DDD on your project work?</li>
         </ul>
         <p>If you fit into one of these categories, then this workshop is for you. This workshop will provide you with a solid grounding in the foundational ideas, techniques and skills for doing DDD well in your own project context.</p>

         <h2 class="speaker-subheader">What you will learn</h2>
         <ul class="copy-list">
            <li>Understanding what business problems DDD addresses.</li>
            <li>The connection between software design and DDD methodology.</li>
            <li>Building a ubiquitous language to bridge communication gaps between business and technical teams.</li>
            <li>Hands-on domain modeling using EventStorming for collaborative discovery.</li>
            <li>Refactoring code toward a ubiquitous language.</li>
            <li>Key building block patterns for domain modeling implementation.</li>
            <li>Context mapping for guiding large-scale, multi-team design efforts.</li>
            <li>Identifying core domains where DDD creates greatest impact and supporting architectural patterns.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>The workshop is very hands-on and interactive, will help you connect everything in DDD together and see how it fits and what's most important, and give you practical tools to take away and try on your project. We will be doing some pairing exercises which will require laptops. We will be reading code, but no coding experience is necessary.</p>
         <p>Only available in-person in the USA this year at Explore DDD.</p>
