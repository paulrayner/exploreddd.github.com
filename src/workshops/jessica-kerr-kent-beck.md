                <p>Are you frustrated with how illogical the world is? Baffled by how smart people and well written software can do wrong things?</p>
                <p>If you long for the days when programs were Correct and people believed Rightly,</p>
                <p>Well sorry, we can’t help you.</p>
                <p>But if you’re ready to find new ways of making sense in the world, and new tools for acting in the world as it is, this workshop is for you.</p>
                <p>Kent Beck and Jessica Kerr will step through an introduction to systems thinking. With examples from software and life, with concepts like feedback loops and leverage points and propensities, we will step through the basics of seeing and changing systems.</p>
                <p>Let’s resolve paradoxes like Thesues’s ship and Chicken and egg. Gain insight into distributed systems and symmathesies. Answer questions like, why is romantic love so powerful? And why does software get harder to change over time? Or why will your enterprise never let you self organize?</p>
                <p>Come with your questions, leave with new (maybe better?) questions.</p>
