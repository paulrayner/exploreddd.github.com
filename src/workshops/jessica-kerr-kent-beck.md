                <h1>Intro to Systems Thinking</h1>
                <p><span class="speaker-name">Jessica Kerr &amp; Kent Beck</span>
                <span class="duration">November 10 &amp; 12, 2020<br>10:30 AM - 2:00 PM (MST)</span></p>
                <p>Are you frustrated with how illogical the world is and baffled by how smart people and well-written software can do wrong things?<p>
                <p>If you long for the days when programs were correct and people believed rightly, well sorry, we can’t help you.</p>
                <p><em>But</em> if you’re ready to find new ways of making sense of the world, and discovering new tools for acting in the world as it is right now, this workshop is for you.</p>
                <p>Kent Beck and Jessica Kerr will step through an introduction to systems thinking. With examples from software and life, and concepts like feedback loops and leverage points and propensities, we will step through the basics of seeing and changing systems.</p>
                <p>We will resolve paradoxes like “Theseus’s Ship” and “The Chicken and The Egg”, gain insight into distributed systems and symmathesies, and answer questions like, “Why is romantic love so powerful?” and “Why does software get harder to change over time?” and “Why will your enterprise never let you self-organize?”</p>
                <p>Come with your questions, leave with new (and maybe even better?) questions.</p>
                <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
                <p>Someone who has broken down their system reductively optimized each bit, and reached the limit of usefulness of that view, despaired of any alternatives, reduced to action for action’s sake.</p>
                <p>Someone who has heard of systems thinking, but not read the books. Who has time to read all that? Chat with Kent and Jessica instead. Then you’ll be excited about reading the books.</p>
                <h2>What You’ll Learn:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>How to notice feedback loops.</li>
                    <li>How to distinguish levels.</li>
                    <li>How to find leverage points for change.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>What You’ll Unlearn:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cause comes before effect.</li>
                    <li>Coordination comes from centralized control.</li>
                    <li>Things happen because someone intends them to happen.</li>
                    <li>If something works, we can scale it.</li>
                    <li>Science is about knowing things.</li>
                    <li>Certainty is our friend.</li>
                    <li>Human error is a root cause.</li>
                    <li>Constraints reduce possibilities.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Session 1</h2>
                <p>We’ll introduce some of the concepts of systems thinking (feedback loops, circular causality,  levels) and describe examples we’ve seen in software, biology, and our own lives. We’ll ask you for examples of things that don’t work rationally, and then see if we can make sense of them with an influence diagram.</p>
                <h2>Session 2</h2>
                <p>Once we see a system, how do we change it? Based on the scenarios people bring up in the first session, we’ll go over the leverage points in a system. You may be surprised at which ones are the most powerful. We’ll talk about how systems change, and what helps them sustain. Go
                away with ideas of how we can keep our software resilient and our teams growing.</p>
                <h2>WORKSHOP FORMAT</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>180-minute sessions</li>
                    <li>30-minute break</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>About Jessica Kerr</h2>
                <p>Jessica Kerr makes software to help others write software to help themselves build software. She lives in St. Louis, Missouri and works remotely for Atomist. Her adventures include advocating for functional programming and systems thinking at software conferences around the world, keeping two children alive (so far), and podcasting on Greater Than Code. Find her on twitter and Medium as <a href="https://twitter.com/jessitron">@jessitron</a>.</p>
                <h2>About Kent Beck</h2>
                <p>Kent consistently challenges software engineering dogma, promoting ideas like patterns, test-driven development, and Extreme Programming. Currently affiliated with Three Rivers Institute and Gusto, he is the author of many Addison-Wesley titles.</p>
