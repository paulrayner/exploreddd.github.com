        <p>Domain-Driven Design (“DDD”) is an approach to delivering software for complex needs through evolving a model of key business concepts in the software itself. It is not a technology or a methodology, but rather principles, patterns, and practices for making effective design decisions to focus and accelerate software projects dealing with complicated domains.</p>
