    <p>Explore DDD is a conference with Domain-Driven Design at the center, with participants sharing insights, experiences,
    and experiments in real-world software design.</p>
    <p>The main themes of the 2025 conference are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>DDD in the Cloud (includes arch modernization, distributed systems, legacy systems, etc.)</li>
      <li>DDD with LLMs (carry forward that thread from Eric’s 2024 call to action)</li>
      <li>DDD for Big Data</li>
      <li>Systems Thinking for Software Design</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We are especially interested in sessions highlighting these themes. We look for content that shares a pragmatic and
    grounded approach to the challenges of modeling and design, especially through case studies.</p>

    <p><em>To maximize your chances of being on the conference program, please read and follow the CFP guidelines below
        carefully.</em></p>

    <h2 class="page-subheader">CFP Guidelines</h2>

    <p>We are dedicated to creating a safe, welcoming environment for everyone. As part of submitting a proposal, you agree to comply with the conference <a href="../about">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="page-subheader">Formats</h2>

    <p>You can propose as many sessions as you like for any of these formats:</p>

    <div class="table-responsive">
      <table class="table table-striped">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Format</th>
            <th>Length</th>

    </div>
    <p><em>Note: Regular talks will be professionally video recorded and made freely available online after the
        conference.</em></p>

    <h2 class="page-subheader">What About Running a Conference Hands-on Session?</h2>

    <p>An ideal conference two hour hands-on session:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>is focused on a domain, a methodology, or an approach, rather than a technology</li>
      <li>favors practice over theory</li>
      <li>can range from experimental to well-known formats</li>
      <li>puts the &quot;work&quot; in &quot;workshop&quot;: modeling, drawing, writing, discussing, coding, …</li>
      <li>encourages collaboration between participants</li>
      <li>makes you want to go to the office on Monday and change the way you work!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We're especially interested in hands-on sessions that include hands-on coding exercises. Be sure to include details about the coding language in your session description so attendees know what to expect.</p>

    <p>What to expect for your hands-on session:  tables groupings or rounds for 6 people; power provided to the tables; screen with HDMI connection; Bluetooth speakers available for sound; easel with Post-it easel pad and markers; rolls of paper; sticky notes and sharpies.  Speakers will not be mic’d.</p>

    <p><strong>PRE-CONFERENCE WORKSHOP DETAILS</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Workshops will run 8 hours each day with a lunch break</li>
			<li>We will provide power to tables and screens for slides</li>
			<li>Let us know your preferred setup in your submission</li>
		</ul>

    <h2 class="page-subheader">Increase Your Chances</h2>

    <p>Evaluating a submission based on nothing but an abstract is hard. <em>Help us get to know you and your ideas by:</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Sending us links to your content.</li>
      <li>Blogging about your topic.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We generally prefer talks that are not technology-specific, although exceptions are possible. Code examples in talks are welcome, but should be understandable by developers not familiar with your programming language.</p>

    <p>Building a program involves lots of trade offs, and often we have the painful task of refusing great proposals for other reasons than the topic. If yours is not accepted, please consider this an <em>invitation to try again next year</em>.</p>

    <p>A 1-minute soft pitch at the beginning or end of your talk is acceptable, but don&#39;t make your talk a sales pitch.</p>

    <h2 class="page-subheader">Submission Process</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Send us <strong>as many submission proposals as you’d like in the CFP form</strong>, for as many of the accepted
        formats as you like, before the submission deadline.</li>
      <li>We are likely to start accepting proposals before the deadline, so <strong>being early helps</strong>.</li>
      <li>We might ask you to have a <strong>short conference call</strong> with us. Sometimes we like to ask for clarifications, or suggest changes to the contents or the format. If we contact you for such a call, it is not a guarantee your proposal will be accepted.</li>
      <li>We’ll notify you at latest 30 days after the submission deadline whether your idea is accepted or not. We&#39;ll ask for a final confirmation before announcing you.</li>
      <li>Even after you&#39;ve been accepted, we&#39;d like to help you make the most of your presentation or workshop. That&#39;s why we offer <strong>presentation support</strong>. We&#39;ll put you in touch with other speakers, to help you develop your material, be your sounding board, and give you feedback. We might also ask you to do the same for others. We&#39;ve found that even for experienced speakers, a bit of back and forth can greatly improve the presentation or workshop. </li>
    </ol>
