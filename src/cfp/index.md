    <p>Explore DDD is a conference with Domain-Driven Design at the center, with participants sharing insights, experiences,
    and experiments in real-world software design.</p>
    <p>The main themes of the 2025 conference are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>DDD in the Cloud (includes arch modernization, distributed systems, legacy systems, etc.)</li>
      <li>DDD with LLMs (carry forward that thread from Ericâ€™s 2024 call to action)</li>
      <li>DDD for Big Data</li>
      <li>Systems Thinking for Software Design</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We are especially interested in sessions highlighting these themes. We look for content that shares a pragmatic and
    grounded approach to the challenges of modeling and design, especially through case studies.</p>
