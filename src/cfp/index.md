		<h1 class="text-center">Call for Proposal</h1>
		<h3 class="text-center">CFP Is Now Closed</h3>
		<p>Should you submit your talk or hands-on session idea?</p>
		<p>Yes, definitely! Submitting proposals is your job. Worrying about what fits the program is ours. When in doubt, submit your proposal.</p>
		<p>We are dedicated to creating a safe, welcoming environment for everyone. As part of submitting a proposal, you agree to comply with the conference <a href="../faq/">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
		<p><em>To maximize your chances of being on the conference program, please read and follow the CFP guidelines below carefully.</em></p>
		<p><em>Read through the guidelines below and still need help? Reach out to us via email <a href="mailto:contact@exploreddd.com">contact@exploreddd.com</a>. If you would like support to help you develop your unfinished ideas into a great session, just let us know and we'll connect you with someone who can help.</em></p>
		<p><strong>CFP GUIDELINES</strong></p>
		<p>Explore DDD is a conference with Domain-Driven Design at the center, with participants sharing insights, experiences, and experiments in real-world software design. We are aiming for content that shares a pragmatic and grounded approach to modeling and design.</p>
		<p>Presenters should aim to share stories of the tradeoffs, missteps and challenges they’ve encountered in software design, as well as how it has accelerated development. Design is hard, so we don't want to downplay the challenges of doing good design in the messy rough-and-tumble environment of delivering successful software solutions. We're interested in DDD-flavored approaches to topics such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Applying DDD, especially hands-on sessions, case studies, experience reports, post mortems/"war stories"…</li>
			<li>Software analysis, modeling, and design</li>
			<li>Visualization and collaboration techniques</li>
			<li>Design and agile process</li>
			<li>Software architecture</li>
			<li>Systems Thinking, Complexity theory, …</li>
			<li>Testing and refactoring</li>
			<li>Strategy, organization, bridging technology and business</li>
			<li>Distributed systems design</li>
			<li>Challenges to particular aspects of DDD</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>FORMATS</strong></p>
		<p>You can propose as many sessions as you like for any of these formats:</p>
		<table class="table">
			<tr>
				<th><strong>Format</strong></th>
				<th><strong>Length</strong></th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Talk Session</td>
				<td>45 min</td>

			<tr>
				<td>Hands-on session</td>
				<td>120 min</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>2-day pre-conference workshop <br />(Tuesday &amp; Wednesday)</td>
				<td>16 hours</td>
			</tr>
  		</table>
		<p><em>Note: Conference Talk Sessions will be professionally video recorded and made freely available online after the conference.</em></p>
		<p><strong>WHAT ABOUT RUNNING A CONFERENCE HANDS-ON SESSION?</strong></p>
		<p>An ideal conference one hour and forty-five minute hands-on session:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>is focused on a domain, a methodology, or an approach, rather than a technology</li>
			<li>favors practice over theory</li>
			<li>can range from experimental to well-known formats</li>
			<li>puts the "work" in "workshop": modeling, drawing, writing, discussing, coding, …</li>
			<li>encourages collaboration between participants</li>
			<li>makes you want to go to the office on Monday and change the way you work!</li>
		</ul>
		<p>What to expect for your hands-on session space: the room will be set up with groups of tables with power provided to the tables. There will be a screen and projector, a whiteboard with markers and eraser, an easel with a Post-it easel pad and markers, and a roll of paper with tape for the wall. Sticky notes and sharpies will be scattered on the tables and additional stickies are available on request.</p>
		<p><strong>PRE-CONFERENCE WORKSHOP DETAILS</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Workshops will run 8 hours each day with a lunch break</li>
			<li>We will provide power to tables and screens for slides</li>
			<li>Let us know your preferred setup in your submission</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>INCREASE YOUR CHANCES</strong></p>
		<p>Evaluating a submission based on nothing but an abstract is hard. Help us get to know you and your ideas by:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Sending us links to your content.</li>
			<li>Blogging about your topic.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We generally prefer talks that are not technology-specific, although exceptions are possible. Code examples in talks are welcome, but should be understandable by developers not familiar with your programming language.</p>
		<p>Building a program involves lots of trade offs, and often we have the painful task of refusing great proposals for other reasons than the topic. If yours is not accepted, please consider this an <em>invitation to try again next year</em>.</p>
		<p>A 1-minute soft pitch at the beginning or end of your talk is acceptable, but don't make your talk a sales pitch. Instead, if you would like to pitch your product or service, we provide plenty of <a href="../sponsors/">sponsorship opportunities</a>.</p>
		<p><strong>Submission Process</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li>Send us as many <strong>submission proposals as you’d like in the CFP form</strong>, for as many of the accepted formats as you like, before the submission deadline.</li>
			<li>We are likely to start accepting proposals before the deadline, so <strong>being early helps</strong>.</li>
			<li>We might ask you to have a <strong>short conference call</strong> with us. Sometimes we like to ask for clarifications, or suggest changes to the contents or the format. If we contact you for such a call, it is not a guarantee your proposal will be accepted.</li>
			<li>We’ll notify you at latest 30 days after the submission deadline whether your idea is accepted or not. We'll ask for a final confirmation before announcing you.</li>
			<li>Even after you've been accepted, we'd like to help you make the most of your presentation or workshop. That's why we offer <strong>presentation support</strong>. We'll put you in touch with other speakers, to help you develop your material, be your sounding board, and give you feedback. We might also ask you to do the same for others. We've found that even for experienced speakers, a bit of back and forth can greatly improve the presentation or workshop.</li>
		</ol>
