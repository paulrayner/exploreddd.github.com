		<h3 class="text-center">CFP WILL OPEN SOON<h3>

		CFP Deadline is April 30, 2023
		Should you submit your talk or hands-on session idea?
		Yes, definitely! Submitting proposals is your job. Worrying about what fits the program is ours. When in doubt, submit your proposal.
		We are dedicated to creating a safe, welcoming environment for everyone. As part of submitting a proposal, you agree to comply with the conference Code of Conduct.
		To maximize your chances of being on the conference program, please read and follow the CFP guidelines below carefully.
		Read through the guidelines below and still need help? Reach out to us via email contact@exploreddd.com. If you would like support to help you develop your unfinished ideas into a great session, just let us know and we'll connect you with someone who can help.
		CFP GUIDELINES
		Explore DDD is a conference with Domain-Driven Design at the center, with participants sharing insights, experiences, and experiments in real-world software design. We are aiming for content that shares a pragmatic and grounded approach to modeling and design.
		Presenters should aim to share stories of the tradeoffs, missteps and challenges they’ve encountered in software design, as well as how it has accelerated development. Design is hard, so we don't want to downplay the challenges of doing good design in the messy rough-and-tumble environment of delivering successful software solutions. We're interested in DDD-flavored approaches to topics such as:
		Applying DDD, especially hands-on sessions, case studies, experience reports, post mortems/"war stories"…
		Software analysis, modeling, and design
		Visualization and collaboration techniques
		Design and agile process
		Software architecture
		Systems Thinking, Complexity theory, …
		Testing and refactoring
		Strategy, organization, bridging technology and business
		Distributed systems design
		Challenges to particular aspects of DDD


		FORMATS
		You can propose as many sessions as you like for any of these formats:
		Format
		Length
		Talk Session
		45 min
		Hands-on session
		1 hour 45 min


		Note: Conference Talk Sessions will be professionally video recorded and made freely available online after the conference.
		WHAT ABOUT RUNNING A CONFERENCE HANDS-ON SESSION?
		An ideal conference one hour and forty-five minute hands-on session:
		is focused on a domain, a methodology, or an approach, rather than a technology
		favors practice over theory
		can range from experimental to well-known formats
		puts the "work" in "workshop": modeling, drawing, writing, discussing, coding, …
		encourages collaboration between participants
		makes you want to go to the office on Monday and change the way you work!
		What to expect for your hands-on session space: the room will be set up with groups of tables with power provided to the tables. There will be a screen and projector, a whiteboard with markers and eraser, an easel with a Post-it easel pad and markers, and a roll of paper with tape for the wall. Sticky notes and sharpies will be scattered on the tables and additional stickies are available on request.
		INCREASE YOUR CHANCES
		Evaluating a submission based on nothing but an abstract is hard. Help us get to know you and your ideas by:
		Sending us links to your content.
		Blogging about your topic.
		We generally prefer talks that are not technology-specific, although exceptions are possible. Code examples in talks are welcome, but should be understandable by developers not familiar with your programming language.
		Building a program involves lots of trade offs, and often we have the painful task of refusing great proposals for other reasons than the topic. If yours is not accepted, please consider this an invitation to try again next year.
		A 1-minute soft pitch at the beginning or end of your talk is acceptable, but don't make your talk a sales pitch. Instead, if you would like to pitch your product or service, we provide plenty of sponsorship opportunities.
		SUBMISSION PROCESS
		1.    Send us as many submission proposals as you’d like in the CFP form, for as many of the accepted formats as you like, before the submission deadline.
		2.    We are likely to start accepting proposals before the deadline, so being early helps.
		3.    We might ask you to have a short conference call with us. Sometimes we like to ask for clarifications, or suggest changes to the contents or the format. If we contact you for such a call, it is not a guarantee your proposal will be accepted.
		4.    We’ll notify you at latest 30 days after the submission deadline whether your idea is accepted or not. We'll ask for a final confirmation before announcing you.
		5.    Even after you've been accepted, we'd like to help you make the most of your presentation or workshop. That's why we offer presentation support. We'll put you in touch with other speakers, to help you develop your material, be your sounding board, and give you feedback. We might also ask you to do the same for others. We've found that even for experienced speakers, a bit of back and forth can greatly improve the presentation or workshop.


		COMPENSATION
		Our goal is to make this a wonderful, memorable, and welcoming conference experience for all our speakers.
		We offer a travel stipend as follows: $500 for North American speakers and $1000 for international speakers.
		Speakers may receive only 1 stipend per conference. Only 1 stipend will be paid per session, regardless of the number of speakers.
		Speakers will receive a complimentary conference ticket and hotel stay (including breakfast) on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday nights.
		Alternatively, your company can pay for expenses, which increases our ability to fund other conference offerings. We are also happy to offer sponsorship visibility for your company.
		All speakers are invited to the speakers’ dinner, which will be on Thursday evening.
		For any special requirements or custom agreements, please include it in your submission or contact us.


		PRIVACY
		In our CFP the personal information we collect is solely for Explore DDD. We will never provide your email or any other personal information to a third party for marketing purposes. We will use your email for EDDD-related communication. Your name and email will be provided to the conference hotel for room reservation. Your name will also be used on printed schedules and name lists. In each case we will clarify how the information will be used as we ask for it.
		You will be asked to agree with our privacy policy when you fill out the CFP. By providing us with the information, you are giving us consent to use it for the purpose we have specified. We will be videoing and photographing participants (speakers, attendees, sponsors etc.) for promotional purposes during the conference.
		VISA REQUIREMENTS
		For those traveling to the USA from overseas, information on visa requirements can be found here.
		Depending on your nationality, you may be able to travel on the visa waiver program (VWP) for business. If so, you will need to fill out an Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). The Visa Waiver Program website explains who qualifies for VWP and has a link for completing the ESTA. If you do not qualify for the VWP, you will need to apply for a B-1 Visa.
