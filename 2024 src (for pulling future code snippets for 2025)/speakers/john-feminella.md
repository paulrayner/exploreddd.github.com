       <h2>Talk Session</h2>
        <h2 class="gold">Building Domain-Driven Organizations for Resilience and Scale</h2>
       <p>Great data is the lifeblood of machine learning, AI, and core business applications. But great data doesn't happen without three critical ingredients: great APIs, well-bounded domains, and teams organized around them. In this session, we'll talk about how domain-driven design can turbocharge an API-first strategy and catalyze agility and resilience for the portfolios of technology leaders.</p>
        <p>We'll show how fusing the best ideas of DDD with a novel set of technical principles will foster innovative, scalable solutions for product teams. We'll present concrete examples of how leading enterprises used this approach to dramatically accelerate progress and cut time to market, improve customer outcomes, and deliver results. By the end of the talk, you'll be equipped to bring this back to your own teams with some tangible ideas about how to run the experiment yourself.</p>
