       <p>Like many of my generation, I was introduced to programming when I was given a Commodore64: from there, the transition from playing games to trying to make one was short and I began to get interested in languages. When I was 16 I upgraded to an 8086 and then followed all the evolutions in hardware, operating systems and programming languages. Over the course of now thirty years in IT, I have developed software from scratch for management systems for a wide variety of fields, and helped teams in their learning and improvement. I am also a co-author of <em>Cronache di Domain-Driven Design</em>, and a co-founder of DDD Open and of Polenta and Deploy.</p> 
       <h2>Hands-On Session</h2>
        <h2 class="gold">Bounded Context is not Enough!</h2>
        <h3>Co-Presented with <a href="alberto-acerbis.html">Alberto Acerbis</a></h3>
       <p>When we consider creating a distributed system, frequently we use Bounded Contexts to handle specific business functions within clearly defined boundaries.</p>
        <p>But is this enough? What about the static dependencies that each microservice has with the database or the servicebus or even with the frontend?</p>
        <p>In this workshop we will explore the concept of Architectural Quantum (an independently deployable component with high functional cohesion) and how it can help us to create a distributed system with a clear separation of concerns.</p>
        <p>Join us to discover a way to implement this architectural solution.</p>
