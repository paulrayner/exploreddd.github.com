       <p>Adrien Abrams has been at the forefront of transformative projects within US healthcare and government, both as an insider and a strategic consultant. His tenure in public service afforded him the chance to orchestrate the development of vital algorithms for the first Accountable Care Organizations and to champion the rescue and stabilization of Healthcare.gov's insurance data infrastructure. As the inaugural Chief Product Officer, he orchestrated the agile rollout of the Medicare Quality Payment Program. Currently, he applies insights garnered from these experiences to the human-centered redesign of Medicare’s claims payment systems. Adrien’s contributions are noted for their fusion of technological innovation with a deep understanding of healthcare administration’s human facets.</p>
       <h2>Talk Session</h2>
        <h2 class="gold">DDD Surrounded by Legacy, Govt Edition</h2>
         <h3>Co-Presented with <a href="john-phamvan.html">John Phamvam</a></h3>
       <p>How does one employ DDD to make meaningful change in an environment where government stakeholders are overburdened with just managing the current operational and regulatory tasks of the nation's largest programs?
        <p>What does a modern system look like when it is an island among decades-old, distributed monoliths?</p>
        <p>How does your team proceed when there is not full buy-in, subject matter experts are too busy to talk, and efforts to implement object-oriented approaches have had mixed success?</p> 
        <p>In this case study, we will present the challenges our team encountered while applying DDD in a federal agency that was not ready for DDD. We will also discuss the approaches we took to acquire the policy and business expertise to build a prototype to demonstrate a different approach to developing a complex government system. In the end, we were able to craft a meaningful, highly realistic prototype of the solution — one that demonstrated an understanding of the business needs and had the flexibility to adapt to constantly changing policy while interoperating with existing legacy systems.</p>
