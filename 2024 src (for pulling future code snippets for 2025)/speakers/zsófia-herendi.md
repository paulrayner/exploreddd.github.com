       <p>Zsófia is a system and solution thinker who has spent almost 20 years bringing developers and business people together an 12+ years working on different teams in an agile environment.  She is a skilled modeler with a passion for diagramming and an addiction to optimizing flow.</p>
        <p>She is not just passionate about solving problems but finding the right problems to solve is one of the key things for her. Probably that’s why she’s been an ambassador of strategic Domain-driven Design (DDD) for more than 6 years now, which also makes it essential for her to be able to develop a shared understanding be it at work or in personal life.</p>
       <h2>Hands-On Session</h2>
        <h2 class="gold">Leveling up with business capabilities</h2>
       <p>Many times in DDD related conversations I was talking about how useful I believe capability modelling is, especially when you want to gain situational awareness at an enterprise. If you had the chance to attend my session at Explore DDD back in 2019 you might know that generally I often suggest using capability modelling especially when you are at a big enterprise and want to learn more about the coverage of how much the business goals are supported. Not to mention how useful capabilities are when it comes to eg. Wardley-mapping where you are not just looking at the situational awareness but also taking it to the next level and talking about evolution. 
        <p>Anyways, I think we can all agree that this can be useful. But have you ever actually done it? Have you ever mapped out business capabilities based on a business model for instance? As a newcomer in any "enterprisy" field you can always use this method to gather your questions based on the capability map and the one thing you need to do is only get those questions answered and you are good to go.
           <p>What I usually use business capabilities for is to generate the right conversations and questions in any situation in my work. And I don't want to keep this experience only to myself, I want this lovely DDD community to not just hear about it but also feel the usefulness by doing this together in a hands-on session.
           <p>In this session I plan to do the following: I'll prepare the business model in advance that we are gonna crunch a little during the session (just to get familiar with the business itself). Then we will map out the business capabilities using the business model as a guidance. Once we have the capabilities, we organize those and will look at how this could help us going forward (even when it comes to finding domain boundaries during designing the architecture).</p>
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>No prerequisites from attendees other than being enthusiastic about collaborative modeling and DDD :)</p>
