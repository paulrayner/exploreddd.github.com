       <p></p>
       <p>I lead the Solution Architecture practice at Fitch Group and have over 25 years of experience in the software industry.

I am passionate about helping technology teams bring the right people together to come up with a plan to solve the right problem.</p>
       <h2>Talk Session</h2>
<h2 class="gold">A First Year Journey with EventStorming, AWS Working Backwards, and Story Mapping in an Enterprise</h2>
       <p>At Fitch we have embraced a few industry best practice workshop styles that have had a tremendous impact on helping our projects to succeed.</p>
        <p>One example is EventStorming, which is a powerful technique for understanding and modeling complex domains. AWS Working Backwards is a methodology for developing products that are customer-centric and aligned with business goals. Story mapping is a technique for visualizing the user experience and breaking down complex features into smaller, more manageable tasks.  Each of these are tools that we’ve used to help projects succeed.</p>
        <p>In this talk, I will share my experiences with using all three in an enterprise setting to set our projects up for success.  I’ll explain what each workshop is good for, and how using elements from all three has helped us launch more products and features faster.  I will discuss the challenges we faced, the lessons we learned, and the benefits we achieved. I will also provide tips and advice for organizations that are considering using these techniques.</p>
