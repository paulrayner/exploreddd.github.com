       <p>I'm an engineer on biotechnology that did a turn in the lab career to follow my instincts and get into the software industry. Even in university I was always the teacher assistant in the IT engineering program, but my love for biotechnology was bigger at that time. After I graduated I realized that the only places where I was able to work were in labs, and always using very old software programs.  So I become a developer (after a few hard study sessions). I love to do software and I love to be an engineer on biotechnology and a woman in tech because that diversity can be visible in software.</p>
