        <h2 class="gold">DDD Tales from Productland</h2>
        <p>Domain-Driven Design was not conceived with products in mind. Many ideas are a perfect fit for tailor-made software, optimized for a specific business scenario.</p>
        <p>Trying to apply DDD principles to products instead, opens new challenges, since many preconditions are not met. Who are the experts? How do we correctly shape our bounded contexts? How do we align with our business strategy? How to maintain product integrity while customers are begging to abandon your design principles? How to align with the buyer's perception when it's flawed?</p>
