       <h2>Hands-On Session</h2>
        <h2 class="gold">Economic prioritization in system redesign</h2>
       <p>When working on a system redesign or leading efforts to create a new platform, we may come to a point where we have to make some tough decisions.</p>
        <p>After our initial domain exploration, a set of opportunities and starting points will naturally emerge. However, we can't pursue all these options at once, considering our limitations in terms of time and resources. We must figure out which course of action is most advantageous, given that we can't tackle them all simultaneously.</p>
        <p>In this hands-on session, we'll dig into the principles and techniques of economic prioritization applied to the system modernization and (re)design context. In these scenarios, multiple paths often present both advantages and disadvantages, and there's a considerable level of uncertainty involved. By employing a framework based on the principles and practices of product management, we will learn how to weigh and assess these opportunities and decide on the most suitable path to start with.</p>
